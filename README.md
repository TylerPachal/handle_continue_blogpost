# HandleContinueBlogpost

This code is used in conjunction with a blogpost I wrote about handle_continue in Elixir.  You can read it here for more information.

The four examples are each a self-contained application.  To run them, change the `mod:` in the [mix.exs](mix.exs) file to the application you want to run, and then run with `mix run --no-halt`.

If you are looking for the proper way to do asynchronous initaliztion, skip right to [application_handle_continue.ex](https://github.com/TylerPachal/handle_continue_blogpost/blob/master/lib/handle_continue_blogpost/application_handle_continue.ex)
